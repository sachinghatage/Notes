					Core Java							

1.switch statement:
This is used when we want to test various values for a single variable.
we can also write case1:case2:case3: in one line.

2.break keyword:
when break keyword is encountered in a loop,it immediately breaks the loop and resumes the statements following the loop.

3.this vs super:
both can be used anywhere in class except static areas.
this is commonly used in constructors and setters.
super is commonly used in method overriding.
constructor can have super() or this() but not both.

4.Method Overloading:
compiler decides which method to be called based on no of parameters,method name,return type thats why it is compile time polymorphism
object reference is used to decide.

5.Method Overriding:
At runtime it is decided which method is to be executed that is called Dynamic dispatch.
runtime object is used to decide.

6.Difference between bufferReader and Scanner?
    BufferReader           Scanner
1.Can read only string        1.can read both string and primitive 
2.Buffer size - 8kb           2.Buffer size - 1kb
3.Synchronized             3.Non-Synchronized

Bitwise
OR	1	0
1	1	1
0	1	0
7.Bitwise operators(|,||,^)?                                
Bitwise
AND	1	0
1	1	0
0       0	0
     If both are 1 then only 1  
     if both are 0 then only 0
Bitwise
XOR	1	0
1	0	1
0	1	0
      
 If both are same then 0                       


8.why java is not considered as 100% object oriented programming language?
Primitive data types
Static methods
No multiple inheritance while using classes
Final classes, which hinders the class for further extensions
